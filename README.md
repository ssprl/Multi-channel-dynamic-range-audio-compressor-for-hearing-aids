# A robust smartphone based multi-channel dynamic-range audio compressor for hearing aids


## Overview
This GitHub repository provides for A robust smartphone based multi-channel dynamic-range audio compressor for hearing aids. The example app provided here is for hearing improvement studies. 

> **Abstract:** Hearing impairment degrades perception of speech and audio signals due to low frequency-dependent audible threshold levels. Hearing aid devices (HADs) apply prescription gains and dynamic-range compressor for improving usersâ€™ audibility without increasing the sound loudness to uncomfortable levels. Multi-channel dynamic-range compressor enhances quality and intelligibility of audio output by targeting each frequency band with different compression parameters such as compression ratio (CR), attack time (AT), and release time (RT). Increasing the number of compressor channels can result in more comfortable audio output when appropriate parameters are defined for each channel. However, the use of more channels increases computational complexity of the multi-channel compressor algorithm limiting its application to some HADs. In this paper, we propose a nine-channel dynamic-range compressor with an optimized structure capable of running on smartphones and other portable digital platforms in real time. Test results showing the performance of proposed method are presented too.
